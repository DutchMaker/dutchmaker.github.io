        <h2>Disk drive head not moving
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Possible cause:</strong> 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the stepper tries to move, but nothing happens, the mechanics are probably stuck because all lubricant dried up.</li>
          <li>If stepper does not move at all and this happens for both disk drives, the FDC (Floppy Disk Controller) chip (FD 1719) may be broken.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure all mechanic parts are well lubricated.</li>
          <li>Try swapping the drives by moving the jumpers from drive A to drive B. If the exact same thing happens with drive B, it's probably not a drive issue.</li>
          <li>Replace the FDC chip with a known working chip.</li>
